* * *
Package for scoring and evaluating discrete-time sequences. A sequence has samples at
times 0,1,...N-1. For each sample, we know the correct value, or reference (REF).
The scorer compares the REF to a hypothesized sequence (HYP).

The data is organized as a collection of sessions. A session is a sequence with a session ID.

The package includes various modules to score the inputs. The results can be computed
at the session level and overall for a group of sessions.
